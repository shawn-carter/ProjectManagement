 Potentially Add:
    Task Templates for common Tasks such as building servers
        Will hold the title, description and skills required
        Can use the existing Create Task View
    Import Assets (Users) from Active Directory / Excel
    Skill Proficiencies
    Views for Assets and Skills - could potentially show skills shortages

Bugs/Things to do:
    Stakeholders allows duplicate Names and Email Address...
        There could be Stakeholders that exist in multiple projects - so we can't use model constraint - will have to be a view/form validation thing. Conditional check for name and email in same project.
    All Projects View is not showing Revised Target Date (which can be seen in the project details)
    Assumption, Issue, Dependency, Stakeholders can currently be added by Normal.User (should not be able to)
    New Projects need a start and end date at creation, but there are projects on the project task list that have no dates.

Questions:
    Should a PM be able to create a task outside of the Project Date Range?
