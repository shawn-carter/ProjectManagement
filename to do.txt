 Potentially Add:
    Task Templates for common Tasks such as building servers
        Will hold the title, description and skills required
        Can use the existing Create Task View
    Import Users from Active Directory / Excel

Bugs/Things to do:
    Stakeholders allows duplicate Names and Email Address...
        There could be Stakeholders that exist in multiple projects - so we can't use model constraint - will have to be a view/form validation thing.

Questions:
    Should a PM be able to create a task outside of the Project Date Range?
