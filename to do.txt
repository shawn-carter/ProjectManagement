 Potentially Add:
    Task Templates for common Tasks such as building servers
        Will hold the title, description and skills required
        Can use the existing Create Task View
    Import Assets (Users) from Active Directory / Excel
    Skill Proficiencies
    Views for Assets and Skills - could potentially show skills shortages

Bugs/Things to do:
    Stakeholders allows duplicate Names and Email Address...
        There could be Stakeholders that exist in multiple projects - so we can't use model constraint - will have to be a view/form validation thing. Conditional check for name and email in same project.
    New Projects need a start and end date at creation, but there are projects on the project task list that have no dates.
        Col said to ignore those projects without dates, they are upcoming work but have no idea when they will be starting.
    Estimated Time to Complete/Actual Time seems to be in minutes (or seconds) needs to be clear that this is in hours, and multiply if necessary to store the time in hours.

Questions:
    Should a PM be able to create a task outside of the Project Date Range?
